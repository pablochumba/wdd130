    <h1>Paris</h1>
    <p>Paris is basically that city everyone already knows, even if they’ve never been there:
        romantic almost by default, a little chaotic, full of history, and with a vibe that
        feels like an old movie but in HD.</p>
    <p>You’ve got the Eiffel Tower popping up everywhere, small streets that look straight out
        of a postcard, and cafés where people sit for hours just talking or pretending to be deep.
        Everything looks so elegant it low-key makes you walk better without realizing it..</p>
