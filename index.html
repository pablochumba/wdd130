            <p>I'm Pablo Chumba from Rancagua. I'm 22 years old.
                I'm someone who cares about people, thinks a little too much, and tries to do the
                right
                thing (most days).
                I like learning new stuff, good conversations, and laughing at myself when life gets
                weird. Big on values, hopefully not so big on drama, taking things one step at a
                time.
                Not perfect,
                still figuring things out, but showing up and moving forward anyway.
                That’s the plan.

            <p>Rancagua is a calm city in central Chile. It is not too big or too busy, which makes
                daily life feel
                simple and familiar. The city is known for its traditional dances, which people
                often
                joke about
                because they are so specific and different that they seem to exist only here. In a
                funny
                way, those
                traditions give Rancagua its own personality. The city is also so quiet and low-key
                that
                people like
                to joke that Rancagua does not even exist. Still, it feels comfortable and real,
                especially for
                those who live there and enjoy its relaxed pace.
